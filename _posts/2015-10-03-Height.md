<p>In this project, we created a height field geometry written in <a href="http://www.pbrt.org" target="_blank">pbrt system</a>, a popular photorealistic rendering system. Although it has already been implemented in the system, the goal in this project is to speed up the original ray-geometry intersection algorithm. I have tried several different algorithm, including variants of digital differential algorithm and KD-tree. My final acceleration structure is five times faster than the original implementation under multicore setting. Everything is written from scratch using C++.</p>
