<p>The light intensity in our world ranges across several magnitudes. However, our usual camera can not capture images with such rich information. In this project, we aim to reconstruct the actual light intensity by taking several normal images under different exposure time. We have implemented the following components: (1) Image Alignment using <a href="http://www.anyhere.com/gward/papers/jgtpap2.pdf" target="_blank">Ward's MTB algorithm</a>; (2) HDR reconstruction algorithm, where we have investigated <a href="http://www.pauldebevec.com/Research/HDR/debevec-siggraph97.pdf" target="_blank">Debevec's</a> and <a href="http://wearcam.org/ece516/comparametrics_references/JEI00219.pdf" target="_blank">Robertson's</a> algorithm; and (3) Our own ghost removal algorithm. The created high dynamic range (HDR) image is then stored in <a href="http://www.openexr.com" target="_blank">EXR format</a>. And the final artifact is created after applying tone mapping to the HDR image. We have wrote everything in C++ with openCV for image I/O.</p>
