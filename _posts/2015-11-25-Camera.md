<p>In this project, we created a realistic camera module in the <a href="http://www.pbrt.org" target="_blank">pbrt system</a>. Given the configuration of any camara (the position and the property of the lenses and the aperture), we can let you use the camera to take pictures in the 3D digital world. For example, we have created Fisheye camera, Double-Gauss camera, Wide-angle camera and Superachromat telescope as shown in the above pictures. Everything is written from scratch using C++.</p>
