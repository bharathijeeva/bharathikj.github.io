		<p>The goal is for machines to <strong>read and understand</strong>
		an arbitrarily-given context (such as an article from the Wikipedia)
		and <strong>answers questions</strong> about the given context.
		In order to achieve this, we need to give machine the ability to think about the question when reading the context.
		This is performed through <strong>attention</strong>, attending to relevant part in the question
		as we read through the context.
		A key concept in this work is that when humasn focus our attention, we take into account different levesl of meaning.
		Sometimes we look for the exact details, did this event happen in 2016 or 2017?
		Sometimes we think more abstractly and treat 2016, 2017, -37, 3.14159 all as just numbers.
		<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		Motivated from this concept, we propose a light-weight enhancement for attention, <strong>fully-aware attention</strong>,
		and an end-to-end neural architecture, <strong>FusionNet</strong>, as illustrated above.
		The performance improved significantly by replacing standard attention with fully-aware attention.
		At the end of my internship (Sep 20th, 2017), we achieved a <strong>new state-of-the-art</strong> on
		the <a href="https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/" target="_blank">Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD)</a>.
		Furthermore, we improved the previous best-reported number by <strong>+5%</strong> on

		<p>The goal of recommendation system is to create an algorithm that is capable of learning to give accurate recommendation to the users, such as music recommendation on iTunes, or movie recommendation on Netflix. Most traditional approaches exploit <strong>user on item ratings</strong> (e.g., 1 to 5 stars) to learn a good recommendation. But in practice, people don't often leave a rating after watching a movie, making the traditional approach less useful. In this work, we assume a more natural case where only <strong>boolean ratings</strong> are present (e.g., user A watched item B or not), and develop effective algorithm to give accurate recommendation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		The scenario can be illustrated by the above figure. To solve this problem, an approach is to learn a <strong>latent vector</strong> for each people and item, where the inner-product of the latent vectors characterize the inclination of the user on the item.
		Therefore to accurately <strong>predict human preference</strong>, we have to find the best latent representation for the users and the items.
		In this work, we proposed a general framework for incorporating feature information (e.g. the age and nationality of users or the characteristic of the item) and graph information (e.g. the Facebook friends relationship of the users) to learn a better representation.
		Furthermore, we investigate the use of <strong>general convex loss</strong> (where we are the first to design efficient optimization method for losses other than the square loss), and found that classification loss can find a more <strong>accurate latent representation</strong>, leading to substantially improved performance.</p>

		<p>While machine learning is useful in many area, it remains challenging for both experts and non-experts to apply them to a newly encountered problem. In particular, we focus on classification problem where we try to learn an algorithm to classify each feature vectors to a discrete class. One method, called <strong>kernel classifier</strong>, achieves the best score for most problems, but is extremely slow. Another method, called <strong>linear classifier</strong>, can sometimes be as good as kernel classifier (while losing for others), but is extremely fast. In this work, we tackle the problem of deciding whether you need to train the bulky kernel classifier when you arrived at a new learning problem.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding the solution with a single pass on the data set is extremely difficult. So we propose to make decision by training a <strong>special classifier</strong> that is efficient and satisfy the same relation with linear classifiers (i.e. if kernel >> linear, then special classifier >> linear; if kernel ~ linear, then special classifier ~ linear). Thus by comparing the relation between the special and the linear classifier, we can predict the behaviour of the expensive kernel classifier. Note that the usefulness of this strategy depends on the efficiency of the special classifier, where our proposed method is able to run in <strong>similar time as linear classfier</strong>. And has excellent prediction performance when used empirically.</p>

		<p>Proteins are important building blocks for living cells, which in terms builds up our lively human body. In order to study proteins in a more systematic way, biologists have formed a topological structure by considering the interaction between varying proteins. This is the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867405008664" target="_blank">protein-protein interaction network</a>, or a protein graph using mathematical jargon. Just as different age group bahave differently in our society (e.g. elders tend to be more conservative, while adolescents are more impetuous), we propose to decompose this convoluted network into <strong>different age group</strong>; and study the graph structure under such decomposition.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what is the age of a protein? In this work, we define <strong>protein age</strong> as it's evolutionary age, the time of it's debut into living species. This phylogenetic (or evolutionary in a simpler term) decomposition is shown in the top left picture. Using such decomposition, we found that the <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.138701" target="blank">standard protein network evolution model</a> is inconsistent with our result. Thus we proposed a modified evolution model, perturbation avoidance model, to explain this inconsistency. Furthermore, we also discovered that older proteins tend to situate not only at geographical center (as shown in the top right picture), but also at the <strong>topological center</strong>.
