		<p>The goal of recommendation system is to create an algorithm that is capable of learning to give accurate recommendation to the users, such as music recommendation on iTunes, or movie recommendation on Netflix. Most traditional approaches exploit <strong>user on item ratings</strong> (e.g., 1 to 5 stars) to learn a good recommendation. But in practice, people don't often leave a rating after watching a movie, making the traditional approach less useful. In this work, we assume a more natural case where only <strong>boolean ratings</strong> are present (e.g., user A watched item B or not), and develop effective algorithm to give accurate recommendation.</p>

        <h4 class="project-title"><a href="autoML/">Project on Automatic Machine Learning</a></h4>
		<p>While machine learning is useful in many area, it remains challenging for both experts and non-experts to apply them to a newly encountered problem. In particular, we focus on classification problem where we try to learn an algorithm to classify each feature vectors to a discrete class. One method, called <strong>kernel classifier</strong>, achieves the best score for most problems, but is extremely slow. Another method, called <strong>linear classifier</strong>, can sometimes be as good as kernel classifier (while losing for the rest), but is extremely fast. In this work, we propose method that can tell you whether you need to train the bulky kernel classifier when you arrived at a new problem.</p>
