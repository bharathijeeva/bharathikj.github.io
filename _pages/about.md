		I am Hsin-Yuan Huang (黃信元) from National Taiwan University,
		currently in my third year of undergraduate.
		I have been studying extensively in computer science and physics.
		And have been doing research in Machine Learning under the supervision of <a href="https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/" target="_blank">prof. Chih-Jen Lin</a>.

		Particularly, I love the following things:
		<ol>
		<li>Understanding and playing with the delightful underlying structure of our physical and social world.</li>
		<li>Simulating, visualizing or, if possible, predicting the movement and behaviour of anything around us.</li>

## My Interest:

Our world is much more to than meets the eye. There are always fascinating equation of motion or some form of latent representation that is guiding our movement and behaviour. In machine learning, finding the suitable latent representation is very crucial, as a good representation often accompany substantially improved performance. This is also related to my recent research project: [Implicit-Feedback Recommender System]({{ site.baseurl }}/research).

I am also passionate at simulating our world. By coding the fundamental principles, pieces by pieces, I feels like I am creating the actual object itself, which is an amazing experience. Simulation is also a very good way to test the possible underlying structure, e.g. in my research project, [Human Protein Interaction Network]({{ site.baseurl }}/research), I did a protein-network simulation to justify our modified evolutionary model. Furthermore, simulation can sometimes give insightful prediction to our real world. And most importantly, to me, the visualized simulation is very charming and fun to watch (E.g. my project on [Fluid Simulation with SPH]({{ site.baseurl }}/course)).
