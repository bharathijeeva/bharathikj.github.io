  Welcome to my personal webpage.
  
  My full name is **Hsin-Yuan Huang** (or in Chinese characters: 黃信元). If you find it difficult to remember or pronounce, you can also call me, **Robert**. To learn more about me, you may [click here](about/).
  
  I am currently an undergraduate student in National Taiwan University, where I double-majored in (and enchanted by) **Computer Science** and **Physics**. For some interesting projects I have done in taking the courses, please go to the [Coursework page](course/).

  My present research field is in **Machine Learning**. But before I came across Machine Learning, I have also worked in Bioinformatics. If you are interested in the details of my research, please go to the [Research page](research/).

  Additionally, I have a strong background in **programming** (started since 7th grade), and have participated in the 25th International Olympiad in Informatics, held in Australia in 2013.
