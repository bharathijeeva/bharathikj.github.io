I am Hsin-Yuan Huang (黃信元) from National Taiwan University,
currently in my fourth year of undergraduate.
I have been studying extensively in computer science and physics.
And have been doing research in Machine Learning under the supervision of <a href="https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/" target="_blank">Prof. Chih-Jen Lin</a>.

## My Interest:

Our world is much more to than meets the eye. There are always fascinating equation of motion or some form of latent representation that is guiding our movement and behaviour. This is the case in physics, which is the central reason why I have the penchant for learning physics. Similarly, in machine learning, finding a good latent representation is very crucial. A good representation often accompany substantially improvement in prediction performance, e.g., take a look at my research project: [Implicit-Feedback Recommender System]({{ site.baseurl }}/research).

I am also passionate about simulating our world. By coding the fundamental principles, piece by piece, it feels like I am creating the actual object itself, which is an amazing experience. Simulation is also a very good way to test the possible underlying structure, e.g. in my research project, [Human Protein Interaction Network]({{ site.baseurl }}/research), I did a protein-network simulation to justify our modified evolutionary model. Furthermore, simulation can sometimes give insightful prediction to our real world. And most importantly, to me, the visualized simulation is very charming and fun to watch (E.g. my project on [Fluid Simulation with SPH]({{ site.baseurl }}/course)).

## My Younger Life:

During high school, I was engrossed at designing algorithms (in a more mathematical fashion). The intricacy of algorithms is fascinating, so I have devoted my first two years (almost completely) in designing and writing C/C++ codes on online judge system (ended up writing more than thousands of codes). And I have wrote many detailed solutions to problems I found interesting in [Blogspot.com](http://momo-funnycodes.blogspot.tw){:target="_blank"} (mostly in Chinese). Luckily, I was selected as the national representative to compete in the 25th International Olympiad in Informatics, and won the bronze medal. After the competition, I was permitted to take undergraduate courses (and some graduate course) in National Taiwan University (GPA: 4.3/4.3) during my last year of high school.
